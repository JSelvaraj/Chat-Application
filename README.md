# Mini Project 1 - 
This project involved designing and implementing a simple chat program that would allow users to communicate with other users over the internet using a TCP connection.

In addition to the basic requirements of hosting and connecting to other instances of this program I also implemented extensions so that a user could send files of arbitrary types to other instances of the program and host a group chat server so that multiple users can communicate with one another at the same time.

This project required me to be familiar with I/O using Java, in particular the use of Sockets and ServerSockets.
